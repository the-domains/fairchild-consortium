Fairchild Consortium has made some bold moves as far as business structure and culture. We are unlike any other studio because we are utilizing bits and pieces from contemporary business and creative leaders. 

Fairchild Consortium believes inventiveness and innovation need to be central to the development process. It is a thin line to walk to make sure that our development decisions are not detrimental to the project, company, or the culture. With that said, we are still on track to deliver an innovative development methodology and inventive product for Virtual Reality.
