First and foremost, Fairchild Consortium would like to thank our clients for challenging us to imagine and create. We want to thank them for allowing us to take their initial ideas and explore different, and sometimes better design solutions. We look forward to continually work with you.

Fairchild Consortium is building a reality unlike any other. We have an Augmented and Virtual vision of the world. We are boldly working on products for an emerging industry. Fairchild Consortium is guided by years of productivity and entertainment software experience focused on delivering a strong offering this year. We have yet to set a release date, but it is coming in 2016\. Fairchild Consortium hopes it will resonate with those courageous enough excited about being early adopters into Virtual Reality.

Are you interested in working on the future, please contact us.
