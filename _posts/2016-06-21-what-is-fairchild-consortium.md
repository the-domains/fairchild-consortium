**What is a consortium?**

A consortium is an association of two or more individuals, companies, organizations or governments (or any combination of these entities) with the objective of participating in a common activity or pooling their resources for achieving a common goal.

**What Is Fairchild Consortium?**

Fairchild Consortium is comprised of passive and interactive entertainment industries' rookies, seasoned intermediates, hardcore veterans, and studios developing immersive products and services across TV, film, video games, augmented reality, and virtual reality.

Our aim is to develop the most addictive and immersive interactive entertainment with analog games, augmented reality games, virtual reality games, and digital games. 

We are bold enough to dive deep into research and development projects merging analog and digital gaming for mobile devices, consoles, and computers. More importantly, our team of futurists are exploring the wonders of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) for creating immersive experiences.

We are less concerned with the Internet of Things, and focused on the Internet of Action.

We will have something special for you in 2016\.
